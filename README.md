## :bookmark_tabs: Projects

### Data Analysis with Python
Includes projects that focus on data analysis using Python libraries such as `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`.

Contains projects that involve data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Check the repository for specific project files and their descriptions [here](https://github.com/pedromst2000/Data-Analysis).

---

### Scientific Computing with Python

Includes projects that focus on scientific computing using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. There are key concepts involved like `data structures`, `algorithms`, `OOP`, and how to perform complex calculations using a variety of tools.

Check the repository for specific project files and their descriptions [here](https://github.com/pedromst2000/Freecodecamp_certifications/tree/master/freecodecamp-certifications/scientific-computing).

).

### Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta)

A collection of projects centred on algorithms, dynamic `DOM` manipulation, `Local Storage` usage for data persistence, and `API` integration for `fetching` external data.
