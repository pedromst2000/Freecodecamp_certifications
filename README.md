# Python_Dev

Python Projects developed for `FreeCodeCamp` or personal projects including `Scientific Computing`, `Data Analysis` and more with Python Frameworks such as `Django`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
Some projects are developed for the `certification` projects (FreeCodeCamp).

In the subfolder `Guide-Course` of `data-analysis` there is documentations about the topics and tools cover it in the projects featured by `FreeCodeCamp`.

The documentations are a review made by me supported and based on what i learned in the course provided by `FreeCodeCamp`.
