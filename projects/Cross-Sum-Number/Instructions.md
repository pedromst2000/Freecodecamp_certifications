## Cross Sum Number

A **Cross Sum Number** is a fun and beginner-friendly Python project where users calculate the sum of the digits of a number. This project helps practice `basic arithmetic`, `loops`, and `user input`.
In this project, its created a simple program with `Tkinter` library to create a GUI application that allows users to input a number and calculate the sum of its digits.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- [x] Design the main application window using `Tkinter`.
- [x] Provide a text box for users to input a number.
- [x] Include a button that triggers the digit sum calculation.
- [x] Write the function to compute the sum of digits from the user input.
- [x] Show the computed sum within the GUI.
- [x] Validate input to ensure only numbers are accepted.
- [x] Use a message box to display errors or results.
- [x] Ensure the app responds appropriately to invalid entries.
- [x] Develop unit tests to verify application functionality.
