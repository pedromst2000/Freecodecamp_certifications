## Mad Libs Generator

A **Mad Libs generator** is a fun and beginner-friendly Python project where users fill in the blanks in a story without knowing the contextâ€”resulting in often silly and surprising stories. This project helps practice `string manipulation`, `user input`, `file handling` (optional), and potentially randomization.
